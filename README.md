# AndroidApp2 — Tim Hortons Clone (Android)

This repository contains a minimal Android app (Kotlin) that replicates core functionality of the Tim Hortons app used in the iOS assignments: a menu list, item detail with quantity selection, and a simple cart with total and place-order action.

Build and run:

1. Open this folder in Android Studio.
2. Let Android Studio sync Gradle and install required SDKs (API 33).
3. Run the `app` module on an emulator or device.

Notes:
- This is a lightweight scaffold intended for instructional purposes.
- Code is commented and organized under `app/src/main/java/com/beebee1985/androidapp2`.

Once you verify locally, commit and push changes to your GitHub repo and send the link to your instructor.
